## Brief Backround

After graduating, I spent a few years working in customer service and doing creative freelancing where I could find work.
After learning some website of html & css, I was spurred to take a few programming classes at a nearby college, where I was lucky enough to learn a little about a lot of different things like data structures & algorithms, assembly language, shaders, and DSP.
Drawn to application development because in practical down-to-earth solutions to common problems, and I think web dev in particular is well suited for that. 
Tools I've used in my projects include typescript, react, redux; and many others.
